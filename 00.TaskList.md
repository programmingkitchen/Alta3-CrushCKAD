Weight: 3%

## Objectives
In this lab, you'll be creating a Pod with specific parameters within a particular namespace. 
This task is testing your ability to, in a timely fashion, piece together a new pod. 
Luckily for us, we have the ability to grab a template pod manifest from our permitted reference materials, 
so there is no need to memorize everything about how to write a manifest, but it does help. 
Permitted reference material you can use while taking the CKAD exam can be found here from kubernetes.io -- Good luck!

## Summary
Create a single pod in namespace talent with the image nginx:1.7.9. The pod should be named singer and the container should be named opera.

## Tasks
1. Create a Pod manifest as specified in the summary.
1. Persist the manifest to ETCD, having it be built in the talent namespace.
1. Verify the Pod was created successfully.

# MULTI-CONTAINER P0DS

Objectives
In this lab, you'll be editing a Pod to include an additional Sidecar. Sidecars are Containers which provide some type of auxiliary support function for the main container within a Pod. These tasks are often simple, but can overload you with lengthy manifests, because you are going to have to work with a manifest which is already persisted to etcd. As such, we consider this a significantly challenging lab, which you will want to be prepared for. Permitted reference material you can use while taking the CKAD exam can be found here from kubernetes.io -- Good luck!

Lab Setup
Run the following command to setup the lab.

student@bchd:~$ drill multi-container-pods

Summary
Missing data has long been a thorn in your company's side. A Tech Lead has whipped up a deployment called snooper in the starfruit namespace. This container running in the deployment mounts a volume and writes logs into a file called /var/log/snooper.log.

Inside this deployment, create a sidecar container named kennylogger, running the image k8s.gcr.io/fluentd-gcp:1.30. This container will require two volumes, the same ephemeral data store snooper-con uses for logging, and a ConfigMap named snooper-fluentd which will inject the FluentD configuration file while naming it fluentd.conf (You will need to rename the file in the configMap) into the /etc/fluentd-config/fluentd.conf filepath (You will need to make this).

The Configuration file for FluentD is located here: ~/mycode/yaml/snooper-fluentd.conf

Reconfigure the snooper deployment and record the change.

Weight: 8%

Tasks
Create the snooper-fluentd ConfigMap.

Locate and obtain the snooper Deployment manifest.

Edit the snooper Deployment manifest according to the summary above.

Persist the configuration change to ETCD in your Kubernetes Cluster.

Verify all objectives were met.

Hints
Create the snooper-fluentd ConfigMap.

Click
There are two ways you can create a ConfigMap. You can either use a kubectl command to create it from a file, or you can create a ConfigMap manifest. If you take the manifest route, be sure to use proper formatting for the configuration file, or it won't work. Don't forget, the filename for our configuration file should be renamed to fluentd.conf.

Locate and obtain the snooper Deployment manifest.

Click
There is a simple kubectl command you can use with a particular flag which will fetch the manifest for you. You'd then need to redirect the output (or copy it) to a file to get started with your changes. Changes of this magnitude should NEVER be completed with the kubectl edit command.

Edit the snooper Deployment manifest according to the summary above.

Click
When you go to edit the Deployment it may be helpful to remove the extra parameters which came from ETCD, such as the entire status key, and defaults which are applied through the API Servers Mutating Admission. Once all of the fluff is cleaned out, this will be much easier. Next, we know we have to mount the snooper-log volume to the new kennylogger container. We'll also have to add the snooper-fluentd ConfigMap as a volume to the Pod, and then mount it to kennylogger.

This is a DIFFICULT task. Be sure to consult your documentation as needed (see objectives).

Persist the configuration change to ETCD in your Kubernetes Cluster.

Click
The hard part is done! Now all we have to do is push the change to ETCD. We can safely assume the deployment was created declaratively, so we should have a very easy time doing this. Be sure to push the updated deployment to the correct namespace. Also, did you catch the phrase record the change in the summary? You have to do something very important here, or else you will lose points on the CKAD.

Verify all objectives were met.

Click
In order to verify all of the steps were successfully completed, you're going to need to verify the pods are running, with both containers available. You'll also have to ensure the volumes were mounted to the kennylogger container correctly. There is a particular command available to you which will allow you to open an interactive terminal session on the kennylogger container.

# Answers
Create the snooper-fluentd ConfigMap.

Click
There are two methods you can deploy to create the ConfigMap. The first is a simple kubectl command.

student@bchd:~$ kubectl create cm snooper-fluentd -n starfruit --from-file=fluentd.conf=mycode/yaml/snooper-fluentd.conf

configmap/snooper-fluentd created


2. The alternative method would be to create a manifest.

student@bchd:~$ vim snooper-fluentd.yaml

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: snooper-fluentd
  namespace: starfruit
data:
  fluentd.conf: |
    <source>
      type tail
      format none
      path /var/log/1.log
      pos_file /var/log/1.log.pos
      tag count.format1
    </source>

    <match **>
      @type stdout
    </match>    
```


Press ESC to exit Insert Mode and type wq! to write and quit out of vim.

With the manifest in hand, we're now able to create our ConfigMap.

student@bchd:~$ kubectl apply -f snooper-fluentd.yaml

configmap/snooper-fluentd created
Locate and obtain the snooper Deployment manifest.

Click
To obtain the snooper Deployment manifest, we'll need to use a kubectl get command with the yaml option, and some redirection magic.

student@bchd:~$ kubectl get deploy -n starfruit snooper -o yaml > snooper.yaml

We strongly recommend editing the manifest to remove the non-required key/value pairs in an effort to clean it up. In our example solution, that's exactly what we're going to show, a sanitized version of the manifest. This may take a minute or two (faster if you have practice), but in the long run, it will save you time.

3. Edit the snooper Deployment manifest according to the summary above.

Click
Edit the manifest to appear as follows.

student@bchd:~$ vim snooper.yaml

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: snooper
  namespace: starfruit
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: snooper
      role: spy
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: snooper
        role: spy
    spec:
      containers:
      - args:
        - /bin/sh
        - -c
        - |
          i=0; while true; do
            echo "$i: $(date)" >> /var/log/snooper.log;
            i=$((i+1));
            sleep 1;
          done          
        image: busybox:1.28
        name: snooper-con
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/log
          name: snooper-log
      - name: kennylogger
        image: registry.k8s.io/fluentd-gcp:1.30
        volumeMounts:
        - name: snooper-fluentd
          mountPath: /etc/fluentd-config/fluentd.conf
          subPath: fluentd.conf
        - mountPath: /var/log
          name: snooper-log
      volumes:
      - emptyDir: {}
        name: snooper-log
      - name: snooper-fluentd
        configMap:
          name: snooper-fluentd

```



Press ESC to exit Insert Mode and type wq! to write and quit out of vim.

Persist the configuration change to ETCD in your Kubernetes Cluster.

Click
Apply the manifest, while being sure to record the change.

student@bchd:~$ kubectl apply -f snooper.yaml --record

deployment.apps/snooper configured
Whenever you see the phrase, record the change, use the record flag! It doesn't have any practicual use case, and it has been deprecated for years; but for some reason they will test your knowledge of the flag.

Verify all objectives were met.

Click
Verify the Deployment is running.

student@bchd:~$ kubectl get deploy -n starfruit snooper
